## explanation of why there are two rows in the export

The token "Amerikaner" (at position 11-23) has two different coreference annotations:

Animate coreference: *->110-2 with type defNP[110] (column 10-11)
Inanimate coreference: *->172-1 with type defNP[172] (column 12-13)
This means "Amerikaner" is part of two different coreference chains simultaneously:

Chain 110-2 (animate)
Chain 172-1 (inanimate)
The script processes each coreference annotation separately, so it creates one relationship for each coreference chain that "Amerikaner" participates in. That's why you see:

Row 1: Pronoun "er" (127-9) → Clause mate "Amerikaner" (110-2) Row 2: Pronoun "er" (127-9) → Clause mate "Amerikaner" (172-1)

This is actually correct behavior because "Amerikaner" could be referring to different entities or concepts in these two chains:

One chain might refer to the Americans as people (animate - chain 110)
Another chain might refer to the Americans as a concept or group (inanimate - chain 172)
Both are valid clause mate relationships for the pronoun "er", which is why both appear in the export. Each row represents a distinct coreference relationship between the pronoun and the clause mate.
