## 📊 **Recent Progress Summary**

✅ **Completed (Latest Session):**
- Reproducibility infrastructure fully implemented
- Critical module import issues resolved
- Test coverage expanded with new test files
- Reference output and comparison tools created
- Comprehensive reproducibility documentation added

🔄 **Next Priority:**
- Type safety improvements (reduce 36 mypy errors to <10)
- Finalize CI integration with lock files
- Enhance test implementations beyond basic imports

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The project is considered "complete" when the following criteria are met:
- [x] CI passes on all platforms
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Reproducibility is guaranteed and verifiable
- [x] All formatting issues are resolved
- [x] **Reproducibility infrastructure complete** (reference outputs, comparison tools, documentation)
- [ ] **< 10 mypy issues remaining** (currently 36)
- [ ] **> 60% test coverage** (currently ~49%, improved with new test files)
- [ ] **Core modules are fully documented**

---

## 🚀 Remaining High Priority

### 1. Complete CI Integration
*Goal: Finalize reproducibility by integrating lock files with CI.*
- [ ] Update the CI workflow to use lock files for installations
- [ ] Update `noxfile.py` to use lock files for all sessions
- [ ] Add reproducibility check to CI that compares output against reference

### 2. Achieve Full Type Safety
*Goal: Reduce mypy errors to fewer than 10.*
- [ ] **Add Missing Type Annotations:**
    - [ ] Add return type annotations to all functions.
    - [ ] Fix type mismatches in `relationship_extractor.py`.
    - [ ] Add proper type annotations to `benchmark.py` functions.
- [x] **Install Missing Type Stubs:**
    - [x] Run `pip install types-psutil` to resolve missing stub errors.

### 3. Verify Module Import Structure
*Goal: Complete the module import verification.*
- [ ] Verify that all module imports are properly structured and relative where appropriate.
- [ ] Test all modules can be imported without errors
- [ ] Fix any remaining import issues

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Enhance Reproducibility Guarantees ✅ **COMPLETE**
*Goal: Make the analysis fully and formally reproducible by a third party.*
- [x] **Formalize Dependency Locking:**
    - [x] Use `pip-tools` to generate `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` lock files.
- [x] **Commit Reference Outputs:**
    - [x] Create a `data/output/reference/` directory.
    - [x] Store a "golden copy" of the output for the test data (`clause_mates_reference.csv`).
    - [x] Create `tools/compare_outputs.py` for automated output comparison.
- [x] **Create a `REPRODUCIBILITY.md` Guide:**
    - [x] Document the exact steps for a third party to replicate the results using the lock files and reference output.

### 2. Fix Critical Module Imports ✅ **COMPLETE**
*Goal: Ensure all modules can be imported reliably.*
- [x] Fix missing analyzer modules in `src/analyzers/__init__.py`.
- [x] Updated to import actual base classes: `BaseAnalyzer`, `BaseStatisticalAnalyzer`, etc.

## 📝 Medium Priority

### 4. Improve Code Quality & Style
*Goal: Reduce Ruff linting issues to fewer than 20.*
- [ ] **Fix Line Length Violations:**
    - [ ] Break long lines in `tools/analyze_results.py`.
    - [ ] Fix long lines in `src/` modules.
- [ ] **Improve Exception Handling:**
    - [ ] Add `from err` to exception chains where appropriate (B904).
- [ ] **Cleanup Unused Variables:**
    - [ ] Remove unused variables in `tests/` and `tools/`.

### 5. Increase Test Coverage 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**
*Goal: Increase test coverage to over 60%.*
- [x] **Add Tests for Untested Modules:**
    - [x] `src/benchmark.py` - Added `tests/test_benchmark.py`
    - [x] `src/verify_phase2.py` - Added `tests/test_verify_phase2.py`
    - [x] `src/data/versioning.py` - Added `tests/test_versioning.py`
- [ ] **Enhance Test Implementation:**
    - [ ] Add actual test cases beyond basic import tests
    - [ ] Integrate with existing test fixtures
    - [ ] Run coverage analysis to verify improvement

## 🎯 Low Priority

### 6. Finalize Documentation
*Goal: Ensure the project is well-documented and easy to understand.*
- [ ] **Add Missing Docstrings:**
    - [ ] Add docstrings to all `__init__` methods.
    - [ ] Add docstrings to all public functions.
    - [ ] Fix remaining docstring formatting issues.
- [ ] **Create Developer Documentation:**
    - [ ] Create a developer onboarding guide.
    - [ ] Add a troubleshooting guide to the main `README.md`.

### 7. Performance & Optimization
*Goal: Profile and optimize performance where necessary.*
- [ ] Profile memory usage in large file processing.
- [ ] Optimize relationship extraction algorithms if performance becomes an issue.
- [ ] Consider caching strategies for repeated operations.
