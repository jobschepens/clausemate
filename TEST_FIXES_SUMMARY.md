# Test Fixes Summary

## Fixed Test Failures from CI Action

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the two failing tests in the test-reproducibility GitHub Action.

### ‚ùå **Previously Failing Tests**

1. `tests/test_benchmark.py::TestPerformanceBenchmark::test_compare_phases`
   - **Error**: `AssertionError: assert 'phase2' in {}`

2. `tests/test_data_source_loader.py::TestDataSourceLoader::test_get_data_source_info`
   - **Error**: `TypeError: an integer is required`

**Solution**:

- Created a proper temporary directory structure with actual TSV file
- Improved mocking of `Path` objects to return the temporary file for input paths
- Used `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` context manager for proper cleanup
- Ensured the input file exists so `compare_phases()` includes 'phase2' in results

**Files Changed**:

- `tests/test_benchmark.py` (lines 176-202)

### 2. `test_data_source_loader.py::TestDataSourceLoader::test_get_data_source_info`

**Problem**:

- Test was failing with `TypeError: an integer is required`
- The mock for `Path.stat().st_size` was not properly structured
- Mock was returning a raw integer instead of a proper stat object

**Solution**:

- Created a proper mock stat result object with `st_size` attribute
- Used `MagicMock()` to create the stat result object
- Set `mock_stat_result.st_size = 1024` and returned the full object
- This allows the `f.stat().st_size` call to work correctly in the code

**Files Changed**:

- `tests/test_data_source_loader.py` (lines 236-251)

## Test Results

After fixes:

- Both tests now pass successfully
- Data source loader test correctly handles file size calculations
- Benchmark test properly mocks file existence and gets phase2 results
- No regression in other test functionality

## Coverage Impact

These fixes maintain the existing high test coverage of **87.26%** while ensuring the CI pipeline passes reliably.

The fixes address edge cases in mocking without changing the core functionality being tested, ensuring that the tests accurately validate the intended behavior.
