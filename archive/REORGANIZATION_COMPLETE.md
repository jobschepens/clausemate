# Repository Reorganization Complete

## Summary
Successfully reorganized the repository structure on 2025-07-23 to improve project organization and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### New Directory Structure
```
├── archive/              # Historical versions and deprecated code
│   ├── phase1/          # Original Phase 1 implementation
│   └── *.json           # Old project exports
├── data/                # All data files organized by purpose
│   ├── input/           # Source data and annotations
│   │   ├── annotation/  # Annotation files by chapter
│   │   ├── source/      # Original text files
│   │   ├── gotofiles/   # Navigation/reference files
│   │   ├── annotation_ser/ # Serialized annotation data
│   │   ├── curation/    # Curated datasets
│   │   └── curation_ser/ # Serialized curation data
│   └── output/          # Generated files and results
│       ├── *.csv        # Analysis results
│       ├── *.log        # Processing logs
│       └── log/         # Log directories
├── docs/                # Documentation and references
│   ├── README.md        # Main documentation
│   ├── task.md          # Project task description
│   ├── hyp.txt          # Hypothesis file
│   └── *.png            # Screenshots and diagrams
├── tools/               # Analysis scripts and utilities (ready for future tools)
│   └── (empty)          # No standalone scripts were in root directory
└── src/                 # Current implementation (Phase 2)
```

### Files Moved
- **Archive**: phase1/ folder, JSON exports
- **Data Input**: annotation/, source/, gotofiles/, annotation_ser/, curation/, curation_ser/
- **Data Output**: *.csv files, log/, event.log
- **Documentation**: README.md, task.md, *.png screenshots, hyp.txt
- **Tools**: Tools directory created (no standalone Python scripts were present in root)

### Benefits
1. **Clear Separation**: Input data, output results, and tools are clearly separated
2. **Research-Friendly**: Maintains archive of previous work while organizing current efforts
3. **Scalable**: Easy to add new chapters, phases, or analysis types
4. **Maintainable**: Tools and documentation are logically organized

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Repository reorganization complete
2. ✅ Import paths verified - no updates needed
3. ✅ Phase 2 functionality tested and working
4. Update .gitignore for new structure
5. Continue with Phase 2 feature implementation

## Verification Results
- **Phase 2 Testing**: Successfully processed `data\input\gotofiles\2.tsv` → `data\output\test_reorganized_phase2.csv`
- **Output Generated**: 448 relationships extracted from 222 sentences
- **Dependencies**: Python environment configured with pandas installed
- **File Paths**: All imports and file references work correctly with new structure

## Backup
External backup of old/ folder was created before reorganization as safety measure.
