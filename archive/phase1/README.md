# Phase 1 - Clause Mates Analyzer

This folder contains the Phase 1 implementation of the clause mates analyzer, which represents the improved monolithic version with proper structure and documentation.

## Files

- `clause_mates_complete.py` - Main analysis script (monolithic but well-structured)
- `config.py` - Configuration constants and file paths
- `exceptions.py` - Custom exception classes
- `utils.py` - Utility functions for parsing and processing
- `pronoun_classifier.py` - Pronoun classification logic

## Phase 1 Improvements Applied

- âœ… Constants extracted to config.py
- âœ… Type hints added throughout
- âœ… Proper error handling with custom exceptions
- âœ… Functions broken down and modularized
- âœ… Utility functions separated

## Usage

Run from this directory:

```bash
python clause_mates_complete.py
```

## Output

- `clause_mates_phase1_export.csv` - Main data export (created in this directory)
- 463 clause mate relationships
- 35 columns with complete linguistic features
- Processes 222 sentences, 3,665 tokens

## Status

âœ… **WORKING** - Fully functional and tested
ðŸ“Š **Performance** - Fast processing (<1 second)
ðŸ”§ **Maintenance** - Stable, well-documented code
